What It is About:

Based on the established theme of shift, our game revolves around the mechanics of shifting emotions in order to overcome the obstacles in a platforming environment. Although there are countless different types of emotions, our game featured four main emotions each individual would experience, namely, Happy, Sad, Anger and Fear. 

Each emotions equips the main character with different abilities that can and should be utilized to cross different obstacles in the game. The objective of the platformer game is simple, get from start to end (as designated by the beating heart animation shown in our live demostration) in one piece. Stay alive by avoiding fires, water and spike. 

Within this game, we emphasized on the comedic element of the overall gaming experience via the story being told. The game follows the fantasy adventure dreamt by our main character who is sleeping in a hospital bed due to a coma which we would not go into details about. In his adventure, he loses his emotions and soughts to get them back.
